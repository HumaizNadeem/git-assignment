What Did I Learn?

In this assignment, I learned how to use Git for version control and GitHub for hosting code. 
I practiced initializing a Git repo, making commits, creating and switching branches, pushing code to GitHub, 
and simulating collaboration with pull requests. This taught me the basics of how developers work together on projects.
